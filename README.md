# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
This repository is a submission for the second unit of the Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Program that solves the following challenge:

> You are working for a property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods of 
> time on various rental platforms. You need to estimate the typical price for a given property based 
> on the price of similar properties. Your company receives new data in bulk every week. The model needs 
> to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.
> 
> In this project you will build such a pipeline.
